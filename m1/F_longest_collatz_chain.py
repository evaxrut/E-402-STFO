# Find which starting number under a given positive integer n produces the
# longest Collatz chain. This means we start at n and when we are at an
# even value we divide it by two, and for odd values we multiply it by 3 and
# add 1. Each of these procedures are 1 step. We consider the chains to end at 1 (n â‰¤10**6)
