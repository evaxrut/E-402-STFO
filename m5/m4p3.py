# Write code that given a set U and a list S of subsets of U uses integer linear programming to find the lowest number of subsets from S that can be used to cover U. U has at most 20 elements. The first line of input contains a single integer n, the size of U. We will consider U to contain the elements 1, 2, ..., n. The next line contains a single integer s â‰¤ 50, the  number of subsets. The next 2s lines describe the subsets, each 2 lines giving one subset. The first line contains a single integer x, the number of elements in the subset. The second line has x integers, the elements of the subset.
